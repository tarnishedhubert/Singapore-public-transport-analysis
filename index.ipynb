Mapbox also allows us to have nicer map visulisations.\n",
    "- However, the problems is that plotly maps only accepts coordinates based on the World Geodetic System (WGS84).\n",
    "- The coordinates that we have in the geodataframes \"train_location\", \"bus_location\" and \"taxi_location\" are based on the plane coordinate system (SVY21). The plane coordinate system is a transverse mercator projection (with a WGS84 datum) commonly used in Singapore.\n",
    "- We need to change the coordinates to the correct coordinate system (SVY21 -> WGS84). To do this, we will do some math. We will make use of some inverse trigonometric functions like latitude = asin (z/R) and longitude = atan2 (y,x). asin and atan are known as arcsine and acrtangent, they are the inverse of sine and tangent respectively.\n",
    "- Using a class and some functions, we will convert the coordinates and store them in new geodataframes."

    "- In general, with the all tabs active, it seems that most of the areas in Singapore are pretty much covered by public transport. There is not sign of any public transport on the extreme lefts, rights and center of Singapore, since those areas are airport runways and forests. It makes sense since no one lives there.\n",
    "- On the extreme left, there is a line of bus stops that line up all the way to the top left of Singapore. The top left of Singapore is where Lim Chu Kang is situated. Lim Chu Kang is quite isolated from the rest of Singapore, cutted of by forests, rivers and murai airfield. Bus stops are unfortunately the only way reach Lim Chu Kang. There are no mrt/lrt stations or taxi stands in sight.\n",
    "- The line of bus stops connects Lim Chu Kang to the southwest of Singapore, like where Jurong West, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok are.\n",
    "- Since we are already talking about the distribution of bus stops in Singapore, let us switch to the bus stops tab. At first glance, the distribution of bus stops seems to be very evenly distributed across towns in Singapore, except for Lim Chu Kang, which we talked about just now. \n",
    "- However, taking a closer look, there are still some towns, like Lim Chu Kang, where there are hardly to no bus stops in sight.\n",
    "- Theses towns include:\n",
    "    - Bukit Timah\n",
    "    - Tanglin\n",
    "    - Novena\n",
    "- Looking at these three towns, we would have noticed that both Bukit Timah and Tanglin are from district 10 and that Novena is from district 11. These two districts are some of the more expensive towns in Singapore, where the rich families and expats live.\n",
    "- Could this mean that the more expensive the town, the less the bus stops situtated? This hypothesis is quite reasonable, since richer people are able to afford private transport like cars. The need of public transport in these towns wouls hence be a lot lower as compared to the cheaper towns in Singapore.\n",
    "- However, there are a few examples that oppose to this statement. For example, Lim Chu Kang is not exactly an expensive town. But then again, Lim Chu Kang doesnt have many residents, most of the land there are taken up by cemetries.\n",
    "- The better examples that can oppose to this statement are the other towns in district 10 and 11. Ardmore, Holland Road, Newton and Thomson all seem to have a fair share of bus stops, though it is still lesser than most towns in Singapore.\n",
    "- To prevent ourselves from straying too far off from our objectives, we will move onto the mrt/lrt station and taxi stands maps. This hypothesis that we have though can be used in another analysis. This is one of the funs of data anlaysis, we will never know what interesting observations that we can observed from our data."

    "- The rest of the areas and towns of Singapore, the North, the South West and the East, the concentration of mrt/lrt stations is very little.\n",
    "- Now, moving onto the taxi stands tab, it is immediately apparent that there a insanely huge concentration of taxi stands in the south of Singapore, where the central business and shopping districts of Singapore are located. It makes sense though, since the concentration of people there is the highest anywhere in Singapore. All the offices and shopping centres are located there, if there isnt enough public transport there, a huge traffic congestion will definitely result.\n",
    "- There is a decent concentration of taxi stands upper north west, in the districts 10 and 11, which are the richer towns of Singapore. This also makes sense, since taxis are a lot more expensive as compared to buses and trains. Taxis is seem as a luxury to the average Singaporean and one wouldnt ride it everyday. These richer towns are able to afford it though, hence explaining the decent concentration of taxi stands there.\n",
    "- The rest of the areas and towns of Singapore, however, the concentration of taxi stands are very low."

This could be due to the increase in bus fares from 2000 to 2004, as seen from https://landtransportguru.net/chronology-of-fare-adjustments/, however, the train fares did increase during that period too, hence this means that are other factors contributing to the daily ridership decrease. Increase in bus fare is not the only causation, there could be many other factors too.\n",

    "- In the south of Singapore, where the central business and shopping districts are located, there is a very tight cluster of red seen. Let us zoom into the south area of Singapore and have a closer look.\n",
    "- Zooming in, we can see that there are huge passenger volumes in Chinatown, raffles place and Tanjong Pagar. These areas are located in the central business district and some popular tourist spots, so it is to no one's surprised that we can find a huge volume of passengers here.\n",
    "- Raffles place has the biggest big red point among the three, though Chinatown has two red points. Another cluster of red points like Chinatown can again be seen just north east of Chinatown, in bugis, where we can find another two red points situated in the same area.\n",
